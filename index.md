## What is BBQCon?
Lets be honest, we mostly go to cons to drink beer and catch up with our mates... So why not have a con that focusses on that rather than talks and workshops?

Enter BBQCon!

We're going to sit in a field, BBQ, drink beer, chat shit and anything else is a bonus :)

At least for this time, it is a private, invite-only event for friends. If you're reading this, you're probably invited. If you have any friends you can vouch for that would like to come, that's fine as well.

## Where?
Sutton, SK11

Precise location will be provided privately.

## When
* From: August 18th 16:00
* To: August 19th 12:00

## Food / Drinks
Food for 18th and breakfast on 19th is included in the ticket cost - drinks are not. BYOB.

We're going to try and get a selection of weird and wonderful meats, as well as your normal burgers, sausages, etc. 

If you have any dietary requirements, please note them in your ticket and we will accomodate.

## Talks
BBQCon isn't about the talks, but we will have some... with a twist! Talks will probably be 0-15 minutes long, around the fire, without any powerpoint in sight. Talks also don't have to be technical in nature - in fact they're encouraged not to be. So please do volunteer to do a talk on something that interests you!

For example, "How to kick people into the future" or "How to make the perfect coctail". You get the idea.. Feel free to bring props, altho pressure vessels and/or explosives are forbidden! :P

Speak to Don Lor if you'd like to do a talk and he will make sure you get the time to do so.

## Camping
Camping is included in the ticket price, at the same location. There's toilets and a water supply onsite and you can have a shower for an extra £2 on the day. We'll also have a marquee as a communal space with music hopefully and for if the weather goes bad. Wouldn't recommend sleepig in it though!

Everything else you will need to bring yourself. At a minimum I'd recommend bringing:

* A tent
* Camp bed
* Sleeping Bag + pillow
* Chair
* Water bottle
* Big Coat

## Parking
There's a decent amount of parking onsite, less than 100m from where we'll be camped out.

## Cost
£20 per ticket which purely covers the cost of food and camping.

Or just give me cash.
